## Static Lift Rig Tests

### Objective

To find out under what conditions Senserbotâ€™s Aurora robot	will be unable to cross the two platforms of the mock lift setup which are simulating the lift in the Tampines Regional Library (TRL).

### Variables
- Distance of the gap between the two platforms
- Height difference of the two platforms
- Positive value: to a higher platform | negative value: moving to a lower platform
- Robot speed while moving across the gap
- Robot orientation while moving across the gap

### Test Plan
- Pass if the robot is able to cross the platform gap, otherwise it is a fail
- Initial test: change 1 variable at a time and test 3 times for each configuration
- Use the results from the initial test to narrow down to the conditions that is a pass
- Repetitive test: test multiple times to check the reliability of the robot crossing the platform gap under the predetermined conditions
