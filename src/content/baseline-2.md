# Integration Tests

**RMF-Lift and RMF-Doors**

On the second level, integration tests between the Lift as well as Doors
and RMF were carried out to ensure integration quality and correctness
as well as expose any shortcomings or bugs in terms of behavioral
mismatches between the two systems.

A more in depth explanation of the architecture between RMF and the
infrastructure systems can be found in Chapter 10.2.2.
